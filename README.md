## Conway's game of life in C
Little game made in C using SDL to handle windows, events and to draw lines and squares. (planning to use OpenGL directly in the future)

# Cycles are immediate and paused upon clicking
* Press **left click** to **draw** on the square, **maintain** and move mouse to draw **multiple**
* Press **right click** to **remove** the square, **maintain** and move mouse to remove **multiple**
* Press **space** to toggle **pause**
* **Wheel Up and Down** to **increase** or **decrease** the time between cycles from **0 to 1500**
* **ESC** to quit
